key points: 

- limitations of current alignment techniques

    - techniques like RLHF depend on a human evaluator(s) to assess and guide model behavior 
    - as AI models surpass human capabilities, humans may struggle to reliably evaluate and supervise them 

- weak-to-strong generalizations

    - can we use a weak supervisor (less capable model) to effectively elicit the full capabilities of a strong, pretrained model 
    - they used pretrained LMs from the gpt 4 family on tasks involving nlp, chess and reward modeling 

- findings

    - naive fine-tuning: simply fine-tuning strong models on labels generated by weak models leads to the strong models outperforming their weak supervisors -- basically this is the concept of weak-to-strong generalization 
    - performance gap: despite the improvement, the finetuned models do not fully recover the capabilities of the original strong models, indicating limitations of naive fine-tuning 

    - the findings suggest that while weak-to-strong generalizations are possible, they may require more sophisticated techniques than naive fine-tuning to fully exploit the capabilities of strong models 
    - the performance gap highlights the need for more advanced alignment strategies that can effectively elicit strong models' full capabilities without the need for weak models' labels 
    - enhanced techniques: implementing simple methods such as incorporating an auxiliary confidence loss during fine-tuning, significantly improves performance. For example, finetuning gpt-4 with supervision from a gpt 2 level model and using these enhancements approaches gpt 3.5 level performance on nlp tasks 

- implications on ai alignment

    - relying on rlhf may not scale effectively for aligning superintelligence 
    - we need to develop better method to enable weak supervision to bring out strong capabilities
