key points: 

- limitations of current alignment techniques

    - techniques like RLHF depend on a human evaluator(s) to assess and guide model behavior 
    - as AI models surpass human capabilities, humans may struggle to reliably evaluate and supervise them 

- weak-to-strong generalizations

    - can we use a weak supervisor (less capable model) to effectively elicit the full capabilities of a strong, pretrained model 
    - they used pretrained LMs from the gpt 4 family on tasks involving nlp, chess and reward modeling 

- findings

    - naive fine-tuning: simply fine-tuning strong models on labels generated by weak models leads to the strong models outperforming their weak supervisors -- basically this is the concept of weak-to-strong generalization 
    - performance gap: despite the improvement, the finetuned models do not fully recover the capabilities of the original strong models, indicating limitations of naive fine-tuning 

    - the findings suggest that while weak-to-strong generalizations are possible, they may require more sophisticated techniques than naive fine-tuning to fully exploit the capabilities of strong models 
    - the performance gap highlights the need for more advanced alignment strategies that can effectively elicit strong models' full capabilities without the need for weak models' labels 
    - enhanced techniques: implementing simple methods such as incorporating an auxiliary confidence loss during fine-tuning, significantly improves performance. For example, finetuning gpt-4 with supervision from a gpt 2 level model and using these enhancements approaches gpt 3.5 level performance on nlp tasks 

- implications on ai alignment

    - relying on rlhf may not scale effectively for aligning superintelligence 
    - we need to develop better method to enable weak supervision to bring out strong capabilities 


chicken scratch notes 

    trad ML focuses on settings where human supervise models that are weaker / dumber than them..

    superalignment: humans are supervising models much more powerful than them..

question: can we use wedak models to supervise strong models? 
-- we can test this by finetuning large (strong) pretrained models on labels generated by small (weak) models and observing how they generalize to new tasks (weak-to-strong generalization)

why is this possible? 
- strong models could learn to mimic the weak models' behavior during training 
- pretrained models often learn general patterns and structures during training 
- these patterns can be robust and transferable across different tasks 
- when finetuned on a specific task, these models can generalize well 
- the weak models can act as a supervisor by providing labels or feedback to the strong models 
- the strong models can then use these labels to improve their performance on the task 


- we need the weak supervisor to elicit what the strong model already knows 

Strong pretrained models naturally generalize beyond their weak supervisors.

naively finetuning on weak supervision is not enough 

improving weak-to-strong generalization  is tractable
